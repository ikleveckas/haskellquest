# HaskellQuest

**HaskellQuest** is a game designed to teach functional programming concepts in Haskell.
The idea was to make the journey into Haskell a more engaging and interactive experience. Players are encouraged to practically apply the concepts by using the Haskell fundamentals they learn throughout the game in 10 different levels.

## Installation

### Windows

#### 1. Download the Windows version: [HaskellQuest-Windows.zip](https://github.com/ikleveckas/haskellquest/releases/download/v.0.1.0/HaskellQuest-Windows.zip)

#### 2. Extract the HaskellQuest.zip file

#### 3. Run HaskellQuest.exe to start


### MacOS

Mac users need to do a couple of things before playing the game, because of Mac's built-in security protection:

#### 1. Download the Mac version: [HaskellQuest-MacOS.zip](https://github.com/ikleveckas/haskellquest/releases/download/v.0.1.0/HaskellQuest-MacOS.zip).

#### 2. In a shell, cd to the folder containing the file (MacOS.app) that you get when you unpack the zip, and then do

```
chmod +x MacOS.app/Contents/MacOS/HaskellQuest
```
#### 3. Right click on that file in the Finder. That will produce an error pop-up and the game will not run.

#### 4. Right click on that file in the Finder again. That will produce a similar error pop-up but this time it includes an "Open" button.

#### 5. Click on Open.
